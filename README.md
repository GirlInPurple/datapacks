# Datapacks

This repo is for Minecraft Datapacks, the final republic website was moved to [frwebsite](https://github.com/GirlInPurple/frwebsite) because this repo is a mess. The other branches are still here, just locked. I will rewrite this whole repo eventually.

Check releases for finished datapacks, check [here](https://github.com/GirlInPurple/finalrepublic/blob/server_files/projects/Compiling_%26_Contibuting.md) for contributions, check [here](https://github.com/GirlInPurple/finalrepublic/blob/server_files/projects/contributors.mcfunction) for credits.
