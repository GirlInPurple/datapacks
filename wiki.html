                <h2>Southcraft Season 1</h2>
                <h3>Members and Groups</h3>
                <p>The main members for this season are BmBxBBy, DJzombiehunter, AdaxJouse, Gameflame, ToastistGraph23, and several others that have stayed unknown or neutral; with the main groups being the RWA and Vietnam</p>

                <h3>The Withering War</h3>
                <p>The Siege of Spike Hill<br>The first major battle between the two factions, the newly formed "Vietnam", and a faction soon to be called "The RWA" (stands for Realm Wide Assassins) was fought over 17 slimeballs.<br>Granted we were pretty easy targets hunkered down in a small shack in an icespikes biome, but we did not need to have our base irreparably griefed because we wanted payment. bmbxbby, who was the one who initially started the entire conflict between the two factions, just didnt want to pay and instead said "i pay with your blood on my blade" and it caused the entire faction to flee northward to find a jungle, our new home.<br>Shifted Blame:<br>bmbxbby killed Gameflame.<br>And then shifted the blame onto us saying i paid for the assassination.<br>Gameflame saw through this and promptly kicked him out of the newly formed RWA; he then took refuge in our jungle bunker. There were pros and cons to this.<br>Pros:<br>Maxed-out diamond gear<br>Cons:<br>The RWA knows our location and has dropped 3 wither nukes on us, confirmed by video on 17/06/2021.<br>That was the very tiny peak of Vietnam's reign over the jungle<br>Wars End:<br>Because the jungle was so far out from spawn, around 15km, once our beds were destroyed we were doomed to respawn far away from the ruins. Thankfully i survived the raid and was able to last until they left, but our base was a bomb crater at that point, so I had two options; kill myself and respawn in enemy land, or stay and build from the ground up again.<br>The season ended shortly after.</p>

                <h3>Trivia</h3>
                <p>Here is one of the surviving video messages sent by AdaxJouse, around the time of Wars End <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1012703386849787975/1133922223141433414/MOV_1211.mp4">Video Link</a></p>

                <p>There are alot of players that have at least somewhat consistent since season 1, here are a few; <a href="#">@Bmbxbby</a>, <a href="#">@TipDuy3010</a>, <a href="#">@DJzombiehunter</a>, <a href="#">@TrefleCrystal</a>, <a href="#">@squeezal</a>, <a href="#">@AdaxJosue</a>, and <a href="#">@zacrny</a>.<br>Since Season 2 started, we have decided we will never reset the server again unless something catastrophic happens. There are too many people who have joined after and have been active since to list here, but most are fairly well known names here.</p>

                <h3>Trivia</h3>
                <p>The original spelling of the name is "finalrepublic" but spelling it "final republic" is perfectly fine as people will get what you're saying.<br>The game series Final Fantasy was made as Square Enix's final attempt at a popular game, and managed to make it work. Final Republic's name is for a similar reason, this was intended to be my last fully public server before closing it all down, and then the server exploded in popularity, casuing the whole of FR S2 to set into motion.<br>The following is the oldest surviving screenshot of this server's world: <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1061516148325220455/1133123214017564824/2023-01-14_14.png">Screenshot Link</a></p>
