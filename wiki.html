                <br>
                <li>For a while he was running an offical SouthCraft TikTok account, but it has since been deleted and
                    all videos of it have been lost to history. This event is partly why this wiki exists at all. If
                    anyone has any of the videos left on one of their devices, please <a href="about.html" title="Our Contact Page&#13;Click to Visit Page">contact us</a></li>

                <h2>AdaxJosue's Map Triangulation Technique</h2>

                <h3>Origin</h3>
                <p>
                    Not entirely sure on the origin, but there are a few options on where it came from:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>r/Minecraft or r/MCPE on reddit, and just travelling by words from there</li>
                    <li><a href="#bmbxbby">@bmbxbby</a> telling me about it at some point</li>
                    <li>having a map open while exploring and finding it by accident</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I legitimately have no clue where this came from, all i know is that it was used heavily in SC Season 4 and 5. These are just some ideas.
                </p>

                <h3>Usage</h3>
                <p>
                    This technique requires multiple maps, somewhere in the 5 to 64 range, and can be used tp locate any player on Bedrock edition. 
                    Although, there is a downside to this technique, while its accurate nearly to the block, its exponentially time and resource consuming by distance
                </p>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>First, open a map anywhere in the world (see image 1)</li>
                    <li>If the player is on the side of the map, go towards them, while opening more maps as you go so they're not underground (see image 2)</li>
                    <li>If the player icon is in the corner, go in either of the directions they are touching until step 2 is met (see image 1)</li>
                    <li>Depending on the level of map you will get a location accurate to the block (see image 3)</li>
                    <li>You should be able to find them nearby, just go to where they are on the map and look around, maybe go up or down if necessary (see last/unmarked image)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The immedate aftermath was just verbal fighting and <a href="#alakazam6898">@Alakazam6898</a> (then

                    <a href="itsamegaming">@ItSameGaming</a> created the town shortly after joining.
                    They then left to join another server after around a week of playtime.

                <h2>The Borderlands / Borderlands</h2>

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    The Borderlands between Spawn City and Cublak View, are an almost completely unpopulated region just north of the city.
                    It contains a few buildings and the Twin Berry Bridges, Cranberry Bridge having Roads 1 and 4 cross it, and Blueberry Bridge having only Road 4 cross it.
                    The top of the hill near the Spawn City-Borderlands border is constantly covered with animals due to how the server optimizations effect mob pathfinding, always wanting to go up hills, not down them.
                    The Borderlands can also be considered one of the oldest towns on the server, construction having started just before Nether Bay, the second oldest town on the server, only behind Spawn City.
                    The only thing holding it back from the second oldest town was not having a permanent population until fairly recently.

                <p>
                    All but two players on the server lived in this town, the excluded are <a href="#tacco2009">@tacco2009</a> and <a href="#squeezal">@squeezal</a>.
                    The total population peaked at 4, with <a href="#djzombiehunter">@DJzombiehunter</a>, <a href="#tipduy3010">@TipDuy3010</a>,

                <h3>Location and Surrounding Regions</h3>
                <p>
                    CaveTown is, unironically, built almost entirely in a cave, with only a small map wall, a single
                    house, and ~0.2km of paths outside of said cave.
                    The cave is a lush cave, around 40 blocks deep near city center and 50 blocks deep at the lowest.
                    The surrounding regions are a snowy, regular taiga, and massive iceberg biome just off the coast.
                </p>

                <h3>Structures</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A stone pillar was turned into a massive tower for <a href="#zacrny">@zacrny</a> to build a secret base inside
                        of. It later became a storage room.</li>
                    <li>A small farming house towards the top of the cave, as it was the first house it is the most
                        built up out of all of them.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Trivia</h3>
                <li>The term "DevilTown is best" comes from a sign at the very front staircase in the center of the
                    town. The whole naming scheme of the town is based on <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavetown">Cavetown</a>, an indie band.</li>
                <li>A carbon copy of the town was planned to be built in Spawn City, and was around 10% finished. When
                    Spawn City was blown up, a good majority of the entrance was blown up as well. Building has since
                    then ceased and has become a district in Spawn City. Instead, a new project, coined <a
                        href="second-cavetown">CaveTown Thuhai</a> has taken its place.</li>
                <li>The story behind CaveTown is simple; <a href="#djzombiehunter">@DJzombiehunter</a> found a cave near spawn, made a small
                    stone building, and everyone (except 2) followed.</li>

                        The game series Final Fantasy was made as Square Enix's final attempt at a popular game, and managed to make it work. Final Republic's name is for a similar reason, 
                        this was intended to be my last fully public server before closing it all down, and then the server exploded in popularity, casuing the whole of FR S2 to set into motion.

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    The FRTA, or Final Republic Transportation Authority, is a server-wide group based around transit. 
                    6 highways and even more train lines are owned by the FRTA, keeping them as functional as possible, along with buidling more to connect builds to eachother.

                </p>
                <h3>Events</h3>
                <h4>Line Merger</h4>
                <p>To keep the system as simple as possible for people who might not understand how it works and to rebuild Central Station as a passthrough instead of a stopping point, we've merged a few lines together.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Mushroom line between Central Station and Spawn City Farming District has been merged with the Oak Line. The Oak line now goes between Vrynn Harbor and Below The bedrock.</li>
                    <li>The Derevo Line has been rebranded into the Spawn City LRT, as well as plans for an above ground section of Gare de l'origine.</li>
                    <li>The Manegrove line continues past Central Station towards Jungle Depot, creating a new station, Jungle Depot West. It then contiues to the world border.</li>
                    <li>Because of the new Jungle Depot west station, Jungle Depot has been rebranded to Jungle Depot East.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>A list of all the roads on the server (in order of construction)</h3>
                <h4>Road 2</h4>
                <p>
                    The first road in the Network, streching from <a href="bridges">Sine Birdge</a> in <a href="spawn-city">Spawn City</a> to <a href="world-orign-road">World Origin Road Station</a>.
                    It is by far the shortest road in the network, only closely followed by roads 4 and 6.
                </p>
                <h4>Road 1</h4>
                <p>
                    This time, the longest road in the network, streching between Kwazii Penninsula and Rain City, passing by large towns like Below The Bedrock, Cublak View, Spawn City, and Vrynn Harbor. 
                    Construction completed sometime around July 14th 2023 with the completion of the Vrynn Harbor Bridge.
                </p>
                <h4>Road 4</h4>
                <p>
                    Road 4 is the most out-of-the-way out of all of them, passing through only 3 towns total and paralleling Road 1, just farther north and ending on the coast of the Northwegian Sea.
                    There is nothing to say other than Road 4 is the only road with localized road signs, being in Portuguese.
                </p>
                <h4>Road 3</h4>
                <p>
                    The lonliest road so far, only hitting 2 towns, Rain's Town and Vyrnn Harbor. 
                    The section between Vrynn and the Windswept Sea is almost complete, but it is slated to go all the way down to Nether Bay and up to Baystone.
                    A large section of it also overlaps with Road 6, between Vrynn Harbor and Key Island Bridges.
                </p>
                <h4>Road 5</h4>
                <p>
                    A pretty lonly road, like Road 3, but it has a train line paralleling it for a good portion of the journey,
                </p>

                <h3>A list of all the Metro/Railway lines on the server (in order of construction)</h3>
                <h4>Oak Line</h4>
                <p>
                    The first metro line, specifically the segment between Gare de l'orgine and Central Station.
                    It was originally meant ot have far more stations than it currently does in the Spawn City region, one where the Spawn City Lavacast is and one in The Borderlands.
                    It is also the most used line, being the oldest and most built around out of all of them.
                </p>
                <h4>Jungle Line</h4>
                <p>
                    A high speed line serving as an express line for the Oak Line between Central Station and Jungle Depot East.
                    It later connects up to 2 more stations, being a connection with the Manegrove line and ending above Windswept's Gaurdian Farm.
                    This line took the most time to build out of all of them due to having to clear space under Spawn City, a heavily built up region. You wouldnt belive how many tunnels i had to dodge while diggin it out.
                    This line also uses the Vals Memorial Bridge as a tunnel across the river.
                </p>
                <h4>Mangrove Line</h4>
                <p>
                    The longest line out of all of them, stopping at both the Southern and Northern world borders.
                    It also crosses with every other train line at least once, and half the roads on the map too. The ones it misses are Roads 2, 3, and 6.
                    This large extent also gives it the ability to connect litterally everything together, hop on a train in DuyTip Industrial and you can get to Kwazii Penninsula in around 10 minutes, a journey of around 4.5km and would take alomst 20 minutes just walking.
                </p>
                <h4>Spruce Line</h4>
                <p>
                    The Northern East-West counterpart to the Mangrove line, touching the North-Western world border and multiple towns along the way.
                </p>
                <h4>Crimson Line</h4>
                <p>
                    The East-West counterpart to the Mangrove line, similar to the Spruce line, but going all the way across the map, hitting large towns like DuyTip Industrial and Windswept Fang along the way.
                </p>
                <h4>Mushroom Line</h4>
                <p>
                    A line lost to time, as construction has ceased and has merged with the Oak line. 
                    A new Mushroom Line was planned to go between Vrynn Harbor and Nether Bay, crossing paths with the Crimson and Oak Lines, but it never came to fruicition.
                </p>
                <h3>Trivia</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The only building to not be blow up in Spawn City during the Spawn City Bombings is Spawn City North Station.</li>
                    <li>
                        The FRTA was almost built a highway system similar to the American Highway System, with elevated roads and horse depots along it. 
                        This was cancled because of a lack of materials, lack of space in Spawn City for a loop road, and it would destroy quite a few builds.
                        This was eventually morphed into the Roadway system we have today.
                    </li>
                    <li>The FRTA is known under 2 names; "Final Republic Transportation Authority" and "Final Republic Transportation Association". They are basically the same thing and are freely interchangeable.</li>

                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Directly after the <a href="#spawn-city-bombings">Spawn City Bombings</a>, with a bit of overlap during June 2023, 
                    a few of the largest towns got into some light drama, never breaking out into a war but constantly escalating, hense the name.
                </p>

                <p>
                    2 lavacasts were made in Spawn City and discovered on 04/07/23, one was small and the other was go big we named it. Both are part of the Magmososa Mountain Range.
                    To this day it is unknown who or why someone made the lavacast.
                    The only buildings damaged were <a href="#tony142">@Tony142612736</a>'s bunker/house and <a href="#bmbxbby">@bmbxbby</a>'s bunker.

                <p>
                    Kirei tried to steal items out of <a href="#lazydaisyuwu">@lazy_daisy_uwu</a>'s and <a href="#rainforcraft">@RainForCraft</a>'s bases, 
                    and as per the rules Kirei was sent to the gulag and forced to pay for his actions. 
                    It started a server-wide drama over what the rules are and how everything is set up on the discord, mostly around the weird naming scheme of the channels at the time.
                    It also re-kindled the conflict between <a href="#rainforcraft">@RainForCraft</a> and <a href="#minervak">@MinervaKirei</a>.
                    The end of it <a href="#minervak">@MinervaKirei</a> was temp-banned for an unspecfied amount of time and all of the channels were renamed to reduced confusion.
                    <br><br>
                    2 deaths were counted at the end of this conflict. <a href="#djzombiehunter">@DJzombiehunter</a> and <a href="#minervak">@MinervaKirei</a>'s Skeleton Horse.

                <h4>This Conflict's End</h4>
                <p>
                    Considering that <a href="#rainforcraft">@RainForCraft</a> and <a href="#itsamegaming">@ItSameGaming</a> quit the server, plus <a href="#minervak">@MinervaKirei</a> being forced to pay for thier actions, it seems like war is highly unlikley.

                <h2>HumanBeingA1's Unnamed Town</h2>
                <p>
                    HumanBeingA1's Unnamed Town is an enigmatic location, the status of which is unclear. 
                    It is uncertain whether it is an independent town or part of World Origin Road or Spawn City. 
                    It can be assumed it lies in an unincorporated area for the time being.
                    <br>
                    The owner of the town, <a href="#humanbeinga1">@HumanBeingA1</a>, has not logged on since its construction. 
                    It is assumed abandoned.

                <h2>ItSameGaming</h2>
                <p>
                    ItSameGaming was one of many players to build a town on the server, spcifically the town of <a href="#below-the-bedrock">Below The Bedrock</a>. 
                    Now, you might wonder what about them is so importaint that they deserve their own wiki article?
                </p>
                <h3>Building BTB</h3>
                <p>
                    They're a very influential player due to the fact they built one of the largest towns on the server;
                    Below The Bedrock is the 3rd largest town by land area, and 6th by build count. Now that alone
                    doesnt do much, but with the fact they just... gave it away for free? to anyone who wants it? its
                    unreal.
                </p>
                <h3>Leaving Final Republic</h3>
                <p>
                    They left because they simply did not have time or patience for playing or the server drama; and
                    honestly, I would do it too.

                <p>
                    Named after the shape the supports make, Sine Bridge is the most used, and greifed, bridge on the server.
                    Road 1 crosses it on its way into downtown Spawn City, and this has caused it to become a target for many attacks.
                    It was one of the most hit locations during the <a href="#spawn-city-bombings">Spawn City Bombings</a>.

                <p>
                    Named after the color of the two bridges, Blueberry and Rapsberry Bridges are opposites in every way (except being bridges).
                    Rapsberry Bridge carries Road 1 between Below The Bedrock and the Borderlands, while Blueberry bridge does the same, except it goes to Cublak View and Yuri's Town.

                <h3>Castiela Memorial Bridge</h3>
                <p>
                    Based off Skyarrow Bridge from Pokemon Black/White, spanning between Castiela City and Pinwheel Forest.
                    Skyarrow Bridge is based off of the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City, as the region of Unova is based off New York, New Jersey, and southern Connecticut.
                    As of writing this article (Sept 17th, 2023), construction on the final bridge has not started.
                    The bridge is currently a scafolding-based temporary bridge created for Road 1 to cross the valley.

                    Due to Kirei being banned, the users of this bridge are almost non-existent, being only the remaining members of Kirei's town and Kwazii Penninsula, plus some travelers.

                <h3>Names</h3>
                <p>This town was known under 3 different names, here they are listed;</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Ocean Plains:</strong> 
                        This was the name of the canceled FRTA Metro Station to go to this area; it has since become the common name for this region. 
                        It was supposed to be the second station on what was then the Mushroom Line but now would be on the Spruce Line.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Golden Bay City:</strong> 
                        The original name of the city, the town being meant to be the richest and most prosperous town on the server.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Golden Knights Castle:</strong>
                        The name of the only remaining building residing in its borders, the ruins of the old castle of the Golden Knights.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>Construction:</b> 
                    Sometime in Early May 2023, <a href="#djzombiehunter">@DJzombiehunter</a> and @RainForCraft started construction on the castle for a failed group called The Golden Knights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Deconstruction:</b> 
                    Due to @RainForCraft leaving the server, possibly permanently, @DJzombiehunter and @RainForCraft blew up a good portion of the base.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Revival:</b> 
                    @ToxicTrapper has expressed interest in gaining ownership of this base, and it will be granted whenever he is ready.

                    A simple train line going from <a href="#guccimanoff">@Guccimanoff</a>'s base to Central Station, passing through Squeezaltopia and the river before ending next the Central Station.
                    <br>
                    There was a plan to bring this line back using the Derevo Line, that plan was morphed into the Spawn City LRT Line.

                    It was built by them so people had a slightly faster route between the two cities, as an FRTA Oak Line connection to <a href="#rain-city">Rain City</a> was denied.

                <h3>The Withering War | SC Season 1</h3>
                <h4>The Siege of Spike Hill</h4>
                <p>
                    The first major battle between the two factions, the newly formed
                    "Vietnam", and a faction soon to be called "The RWA" (stands for Realm Wide Assassins) was fought
                    over 17 slimeballs.
                    Granted we were pretty easy targets hunkered down in a small shack in an icespikes biome, but we did not need to have our base irreparably griefed because we wanted payment.
                    @bmbxbby, who was the one who initially started the entire conflict between the two factions, just
                    didnt want to pay and instead said "i pay with your blood on my blade" and it caused the entire
                    faction to flee northward to find a jungle, our new home.
                </p>
                <h4>Shifted Blame</h4>
                <p>
                    bmbxbby killed Gameflame, then shifted the blame onto us saying i paid for the assassination.
                    Gameflame saw through this and promptly kicked him out of the newly formed RWA; he then took refuge in our jungle bunker. 
                    There were pros and cons to this.<br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pros</li>
                    Maxed-out diamond gear
                    <br>
                    <li>Cons</li>
                    RWA knows our location and is about to spawn 3 withers on us.
                </ul>
                <p>
                    That was the very tiny peak of Vietnam's reign over the jungle<br>Wars
                    End:<br>Because the jungle was so far out from spawn, around 15km, once our beds were destroyed we
                    were doomed to respawn far away from the ruins. Thankfully i survived the raid and was able to last
                    until they left, but our base was a bomb crater at that point, so I had two options; kill myself and
                    respawn in enemy land, or stay and build from the ground up again.<br>The season ended shortly
                    after.

                <p>
                    The main city, Spawn City, was bombed multiple times in the span of around a month.
                    This string of events is considered the beginning of the <a href="great-escalation">The Great Escalation</a>, but is listed under another name due to its effects on Spawn City months after the events transpired.
                    <br><br>
                    Alot of the info on this article is either vauge due to no information, or intentioanlly left out to not provoke a second spree.
                    Please do not bother anyone involved in this event for any reason, it has been months since this occurred and many of the greifers have appologized to me for these events.
                    This article is for record-keeping purposes only.

                <p>
                    A trapped village with no villagers left, some spare supplies, and redstone scattered around, all
                    built in a giant chasm just NE of Spawn City.

                    The thing is, no players have logged out or said to have owned this base, it is a complete mystery as to who owns this place.
                    There was a post made on the wiki back on July 9th, 2023 asking for someone to claim the town, if not for to keep it, only for historical reasons.
                    Nobody has claimed the town since, and a deal was made that it will go up for auction on July 9th 2024 to the highest bidder.

                <h2>The Final Republic Wiki Page</h2>
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    Orginally created for the admin team to keep track of all of the events and locations on the server,
                    it went public after <a
                        href="https://discord.com/channels/969376256640569474/1075258825252278272/1128968326706643014">a
                        vote</a> was held on the discord that kept it open.
                    The wiki has had its ups and downs,
                    The wiki page on the Final Republic Website is actually quite new, and was created originally by <a
                        href="#ousmblueninja">@OusmBlueNinja</a>, a developer on our team.
                </p>
                <h3>Usage</h3>
                <p>
                    Its supposed to be quite simple, use the filters you like, or search up stuff manually, and voial,
                    wiki pages galore.
                </p>
                <h3>Editing Guidlines</h3>
                <p>
                    There arent really any major rules, these are just suggestions to make everything consistent across the wiki. 
                    Doesnt really matter if you follow them to the letter, but these rules are flexible as it is so it doesnt really matter.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pages are to be writen in HTML, and any JS needed is to use only Vanilla JS</li>
                    <li>If you're going to write an JS in an article, please let us know so we dont completely break it</li>
                    <li>To add onto the above, if you want you can write the page in Markdown and put it through a <a href="https://markdowntohtml.com/">Markdown to HTML Converter</a> and giving that to us is perfectly fine.</li>
                    <li>If you cant/down know how to write in Markdown, just let someone on the Discord know and they should be able to help you.
                        Considering Discord uses Markdown as its main formatting, you should learn it asap</li>
                    <li>Please, <b>do not</b>, use any AI for any articles. 
                        I have attemped to use it before and it either gets facts wrong, is filled with jargon (that i had to look up lol), or sounds like a advert from Apple with how condecending it sounds. 
                        Plus the legal aspect of using it for this; just dont please.</li>
                    <li>If you use AI for any JS or HTML formatting, just doublecheck it before you commit it so we dont kill Github Pages.</li>
                    <li>Please hide all images and videos inside buttons with this format. 
                        The Internal ID should be on the button, the function that runs to make it visible, and the id of the image/video. 
                        Please keep the Internal ID visible on the button so debugging mis-matched ids will be faster</li>
