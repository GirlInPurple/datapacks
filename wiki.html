                    <a href="itsamegaming">@ItSameGaming</a> created the town shortly after joining. 
                    They then left to join another server after around a week of playtime. 
                    They left behind their old gear in a chest labelled for new players only, then left the discord and minecraft servers, never to join again.

                <h3>Inhabitants</h3>
                <p>
                    All but two players on the server lived in this town, the excluded are @tacco2009 and @squeezal. 
                    The total population peaked at 4, with <a href="#djzombiehunter">@DJzombiehunter</a>, @TipDuy3010, @TrefleCrystal, and @zacrny all living in the cave.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Location and Surrounding Regions</h3>
                <p>
                    CaveTown is, unironically, built almost entirely in a cave, with only a small map wall, a single house, and ~0.2km of paths outside of said cave. 
                    The cave is a lush cave, around 40 blocks deep near city center and 50 blocks deep at the lowest. 
                    The surrounding regions are a snowy, regular taiga, and massive iceberg biome just off the coast.</p>
                
                <h3>Structures</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A stone pillar was turned into a massive tower for <a>@zacrny</a> to build a secret base inside of. It later became a storage room.</li>
                    <li>A small farming house towards the top of the cave, as it was the first house it is the most built up out of all of them.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Trivia</h3>
                <li>The term "DevilTown is best" comes from a sign at the very front staircase in the center of the town. The whole naming scheme of the town is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavetown">Cavetown</a>, an indie band.</li>
                <li>A carbon copy of the town was planned to be built in Spawn City, and was around 10% finished. When Spawn City was blown up, a good majority of the entrance was blown up as well. Building has since then ceased and has become a district in Spawn City. Instead, a new project, coined <a href="second-cavetown">CaveTown Thuhai</a> has taken its place.</li>
                <li>The story behind CaveTown is simple; <a>@DJzombiehunter</a> found a cave near spawn, made a small stone building, and everyone (except 2) followed.</li>

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>Originally created by @RainForCraft, <a href="#djzombiehunter">@DJzombiehunter</a>, and @Bench, the Chicken cult was formed out of a joke where a few of us got our hands on chicken heads and made a cult out of it. It was originally formed in the city of <a href="#below-the-bedrock">Below The Bedrock</a>, but has since expanded to Spawn City and Rain's Unnamed Town. Due to @Bench and @RainForCraft quitting the server, the cult has all but disbanded.</p>
                <p>There is nothing else to explain really, just really obscure lore.</p>

Final Republic's name is for a similar reason, this was intended to be my last fully public server before closing it all down, and then the server exploded in popularity, casuing the whole of FR S2 to set into motion.<br>The following is the oldest surviving screenshot of this server's world: <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1061516148325220455/1133123214017564824/2023-01-14_14.png">Screenshot Link</a></p>

                <h3>Building BTB</h3>
                <p>They're a very influential player due to the fact they built one of the largest towns on the server; Below The Bedrock is the 3rd largest town by land area, and 6th by build count.

                <p>They left because they simply did not have time or peitence for playing or the server drama, and honestly, I would do it too.</p>

                <p>This town was known under 3 different names, here they are listed;</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ocean Plains:</strong> This was the name of the canceled FRTA Metro Station to go to this area; it has since become the common name for this region. It was supposed to be the second station on what was then the Mushroom Line but now would be on the Spruce Line.</li>
                    <li><strong>Golden Bay City:</strong> The original name of the city, the town being meant to be the richest and most prosperous town on the server.</li>
                    <li><strong>Golden Knights Castle:</strong> The name of the only remaining building residing in its borders, the ruins of the old castle of the Golden Knights.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>History</p>
                <p><strong>Construction:</strong> Sometime in Early May 2023, <a href="#djzombiehunter">@DJzombiehunter</a> and @RainForCraft started construction on the castle for a failed group called The Golden Knights.</p>
                <p><strong>Deconstruction:</strong> Due to @RainForCraft leaving the server, possibly permanently, me and...</p>
                <p><strong>Revival:</strong> @ToxicTrapper has expressed interest in gaining ownership of this base, and it will be granted whenever he is ready.</p>

                <h2>Southcraft Season 1</h2>
                <h3>Members and Groups</h3>
                <p>The main members for this season are BmBxBBy, <a href="#djzombiehunter">@DJzombiehunter</a>, AdaxJouse, Gameflame, ToastistGraph23, and several others that have stayed unknown or neutral; with the main groups being the RWA and Vietnam</p>

                <h3>The Withering War</h3>
                <p>The Siege of Spike Hill<br>The first major battle between the two factions, the newly formed "Vietnam", and a faction soon to be called "The RWA" (stands for Realm Wide Assassins) was fought over 17 slimeballs.<br>Granted we were pretty easy targets hunkered down in a small shack in an icespikes biome, but we did not need to have our base irreparably griefed because we wanted payment. bmbxbby, who was the one who initially started the entire conflict between the two factions, just didnt want to pay and instead said "i pay with your blood on my blade" and it caused the entire faction to flee northward to find a jungle, our new home.<br>Shifted Blame:<br>bmbxbby killed Gameflame.<br>And then shifted the blame onto us saying i paid for the assassination.<br>Gameflame saw through this and promptly kicked him out of the newly formed RWA; he then took refuge in our jungle bunker. There were pros and cons to this.<br>Pros:<br>Maxed-out diamond gear<br>Cons:<br>The RWA knows our location and has dropped 3 wither nukes on us, confirmed by video on 17/06/2021.<br>That was the very tiny peak of Vietnam's reign over the jungle<br>Wars End:<br>Because the jungle was so far out from spawn, around 15km, once our beds were destroyed we were doomed to respawn far away from the ruins. Thankfully i survived the raid and was able to last until they left, but our base was a bomb crater at that point, so I had two options; kill myself and respawn in enemy land, or stay and build from the ground up again.<br>The season ended shortly after.</p>

                <h3>Trivia</h3>
                <p>Here is one of the surviving video messages sent by AdaxJouse, around the time of Wars End <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1012703386849787975/1133922223141433414/MOV_1211.mp4">Video Link</a></p>

The second place is <a href="#djzombiehunter">@DJzombiehunter</a> (Missed S2) and third is <a href="#treflecrystal">@TrefleCrystal</a> (Missed S1 and S2); fourth place is shared with too many people to list.</p>

                <p><a href="#adaxjosue">@AdaxJosue</a> and GameFlame380344 were always at war with <a href="#bmbxbby">@Bmbxbby</a> and <a href="#djzombiehunter">@DJzombiehunter</a>, usually under the names "RWA" and "Vietnam" (S1 & S5:C) or "Snowdin Peoples Republic" (S4) (or something similar to that) respectively.</p>
                <h3>Trivia</h3>
                <p>As of now, it seems only 1 work file has been saved as a backup on a device, the Season 5 world file. All the others have been either lost or overwritten. If <a href="#adaxjosue">@AdaxJosue</a> could hand over the world files, I'll update this and post a download link.</p>
