                    They then left to join another server after around a week of playtime.
                    They left behind their old gear in a chest labelled for new players only, then left the discord and
                    minecraft servers, never to join again.

                <p>
                    All but two players on the server lived in this town, the excluded are <a href="#tacco2009">@tacco2009</a> and <a href="#squeezal">@squeezal</a>.
                    The total population peaked at 4, with <a href="#djzombiehunter">@DJzombiehunter</a>, <a href="#tipduy3010">@TipDuy3010</a>,

                <h3>Location and Surrounding Regions</h3>
                <p>
                    CaveTown is, unironically, built almost entirely in a cave, with only a small map wall, a single
                    house, and ~0.2km of paths outside of said cave.
                    The cave is a lush cave, around 40 blocks deep near city center and 50 blocks deep at the lowest.
                    The surrounding regions are a snowy, regular taiga, and massive iceberg biome just off the coast.
                </p>

                <h3>Structures</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A stone pillar was turned into a massive tower for <a>@zacrny</a> to build a secret base inside
                        of. It later became a storage room.</li>
                    <li>A small farming house towards the top of the cave, as it was the first house it is the most
                        built up out of all of them.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Trivia</h3>
                <li>The term "DevilTown is best" comes from a sign at the very front staircase in the center of the
                    town. The whole naming scheme of the town is based on <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavetown">Cavetown</a>, an indie band.</li>
                <li>A carbon copy of the town was planned to be built in Spawn City, and was around 10% finished. When
                    Spawn City was blown up, a good majority of the entrance was blown up as well. Building has since
                    then ceased and has become a district in Spawn City. Instead, a new project, coined <a
                        href="second-cavetown">CaveTown Thuhai</a> has taken its place.</li>
                <li>The story behind CaveTown is simple; <a>@DJzombiehunter</a> found a cave near spawn, made a small
                    stone building, and everyone (except 2) followed.</li>

                <h3>Trivia</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The original spelling of the name is "finalrepublic" but spelling it "final republic" is perfectly fine as people will get what you're saying.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The game series Final Fantasy was made as Square Enix's final attempt at a popular game, and managed to make it work. Final Republic's name is for a similar reason, 
                        this was intended to be my last fully public server before closing it all down, and then the server exploded in popularity, casuing the whole of FR S2 to set into motion.

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    The FRTA, or Final Republic Transportation Authority, is a server-wide group based around transit. 
                    6 highways and even more train lines are owned by the FRTA, keeping them as functional as possible, along with buidling more to connect builds to eachother.

                </p>
                <h3>Events</h3>
                <h4>Line Merger</h4>
                <p>To keep the system as simple as possible for people who might not understand how it works and to rebuild Central Station as a passthrough instead of a stopping point, we've merged a few lines together.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Mushroom line between Central Station and Spawn City Farming District has been merged with the Oak Line. The Oak line now goes between Vrynn Harbor and Below The bedrock.</li>
                    <li>The Derevo Line has been rebranded into the Spawn City LRT, as well as plans for an above ground section of Gare de l'origine.</li>
                    <li>The Manegrove line continues past Central Station towards Jungle Depot, creating a new station, Jungle Depot West. It then contiues to the world border.</li>
                    <li>Because of the new Jungle Depot west station, Jungle Depot has been rebranded to Jungle Depot East.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>A list of all the roads on the server (in order of construction)</h3>
                <h4>Road 2</h4>
                <p>
                    The first road in the Network, streching from <a href="bridges">Sine Birdge</a> in <a href="spawn-city">Spawn City</a> to <a href="world-orign-road">World Origin Road Station</a>.
                    It is by far the shortest road in the network, only closely followed by roads 4 and 6.
                </p>
                <h4>Road 1</h4>
                <p>
                    This time, the longest road in the network, streching between Kwazii Penninsula and Rain City, passing by large towns like Below The Bedrock, Cublak View, Spawn City, and Vrynn Harbor. 
                    Construction completed sometime around July 14th 2023 with the completion of the Vrynn Harbor Bridge.
                </p>
                <h4>Road 4</h4>
                <p>
                    Road 4 is the most out-of-the-way out of all of them, passing through only 3 towns total and paralling Road 1, just farther north and ending on the coast of the Northwegian Sea.
                    There is nothing to say other than Road 4 is the only road with localized road signs, being in Português.
                </p>
                <h4>Road 3</h4>
                <p>
                    The lonliest road so far, only hitting 2 towns, Rain's Town and Vyrnn Harbor. 
                    The section between Vrynn and the Windswept Sea is almost complete, but it is slated to go all the way down to Nether Bay and up to Baystone.
                    A large section of it also overlaps with Road 6, between Vrynn Harbor and Key Island Bridges.
                </p>
                <h4>Road 5</h4>
                <p>
                    A pretty lonly road, like Road 3, but it has a train line paralleling it for a good portion of the journey,
                </p>

                <h3>A list of all the Metro/Railway lines on the server (in order of construction)</h3>
                <h4>Oak Line</h4>
                <p>
                    The first metro line, specifically the segment between Gare de l'orgine and Central Station.
                    It was originally meant ot have far more stations than it currently does in the Spawn City region, one where the Spawn City Lavacast is and one in The Borderlands.
                    It is also the most used line, being the oldest and most built around out of all of them.
                </p>
                <h4>Jungle Line</h4>
                <p>
                    A high speed line serving as an express line for the Oak Line between Central Station and Jungle Depot East.
                    It later connects up to 2 more stations, being a connection with the Manegrove line and ending above Windswept's Gaurdian Farm.
                    This line took the most time to build out of all of them due to having to clear space under Spawn City, a heavily built up region. You wouldnt belive how many tunnels i had to dodge while diggin it out.
                    This line also uses the Vals Memorial Bridge as a tunnel across the river.
                </p>
                <h4>Mangrove Line</h4>
                <p>
                    The longest line out of all of them, stopping at both the Southern and Northern world borders.
                    It also crosses with every other train line at least once, and half the roads on the map too. The ones it misses are Roads 2, 3, and 6.
                    This large extent also gives it the ability to connect litterally everything together, hop on a train in DuyTip Industrial and you can get to Kwazii Penninsula in around 10 minutes, a journey of around 4.5km and would take alomst 20 minutes just walking.
                </p>
                <h4>Spruce Line</h4>
                <p>
                    The Northern East-West counterpart to the Mangrove line, touching the North-Western world border and multiple towns along the way.
                </p>
                <h4>Crimson Line</h4>
                <p>
                    The East-West counterpart to the Mangrove line, similar to the Spruce line, but going all the way across the map, hitting large towns like DuyTip Industrial and Windswept Fang along the way.
                </p>
                <h4>Mushroom Line</h4>
                <p>
                    A line lost to time, as construction has ceased and has merged with the Oak line. 
                    A new Mushroom Line was planned to go between Vrynn Harbor and Nether Bay, crossing paths with the Crimson and Oak Lines, but it never came to fruicition.
                </p>
                <h3>Trivia</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The only building to not be blow up in Spawn City during the Spawn City Bombings is Spawn City North Station.</li>
                    <li>
                        The FRTA was almost built a highway system similar to the American Highway System, with elevated roads and horse depots along it. 
                        This was cancled because of a lack of materials, lack of space in Spawn City for a loop road, and it would destroy quite a few builds.
                        This was eventually morphed into the Roadway system we have today.
                    </li>
                    <li>The FRTA is known under 2 names; "Final Republic Transportation Authority" and "Final Republic Transportation Association". They are basically the same thing and are freely interchangeable.</li>

                <p>Names</p>
                <p>This town was known under 3 different names, here they are listed;</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ocean Plains:</strong> This was the name of the canceled FRTA Metro Station to go to
                        this area; it has since become the common name for this region. It was supposed to be the second
                        station on what was then the Mushroom Line but now would be on the Spruce Line.</li>
                    <li><strong>Golden Bay City:</strong> The original name of the city, the town being meant to be the
                        richest and most prosperous town on the server.</li>
                    <li><strong>Golden Knights Castle:</strong> The name of the only remaining building residing in its
                        borders, the ruins of the old castle of the Golden Knights.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>History</p>
                <p><strong>Construction:</strong> Sometime in Early May 2023, <a
                        href="#djzombiehunter">@DJzombiehunter</a> and @RainForCraft started construction on the castle
                    for a failed group called The Golden Knights.</p>
                <p><strong>Deconstruction:</strong> Due to @RainForCraft leaving the server, possibly permanently, me
                    and...</p>
                <p><strong>Revival:</strong> @ToxicTrapper has expressed interest in gaining ownership of this base, and
                    it will be granted whenever he is ready.</p>

                <h2>Southcraft Season 1</h2>
                <h3>Members and Groups</h3>
                <p>The main members for this season are BmBxBBy, <a href="#djzombiehunter">@DJzombiehunter</a>,
                    AdaxJouse, Gameflame, ToastistGraph23, and several others that have stayed unknown or neutral; with
                    the main groups being the RWA and Vietnam</p>

                <h3>The Withering War</h3>
                <p>The Siege of Spike Hill<br>The first major battle between the two factions, the newly formed
                    "Vietnam", and a faction soon to be called "The RWA" (stands for Realm Wide Assassins) was fought
                    over 17 slimeballs.<br>Granted we were pretty easy targets hunkered down in a small shack in an
                    icespikes biome, but we did not need to have our base irreparably griefed because we wanted payment.
                    bmbxbby, who was the one who initially started the entire conflict between the two factions, just
                    didnt want to pay and instead said "i pay with your blood on my blade" and it caused the entire
                    faction to flee northward to find a jungle, our new home.<br>Shifted Blame:<br>bmbxbby killed
                    Gameflame.<br>And then shifted the blame onto us saying i paid for the assassination.<br>Gameflame
                    saw through this and promptly kicked him out of the newly formed RWA; he then took refuge in our
                    jungle bunker. There were pros and cons to this.<br>Pros:<br>Maxed-out diamond gear<br>Cons:<br>The
                    RWA knows our location and has dropped 3 wither nukes on us, confirmed by video on
                    17/06/2021.<br>That was the very tiny peak of Vietnam's reign over the jungle<br>Wars
                    End:<br>Because the jungle was so far out from spawn, around 15km, once our beds were destroyed we
                    were doomed to respawn far away from the ruins. Thankfully i survived the raid and was able to last
                    until they left, but our base was a bomb crater at that point, so I had two options; kill myself and
                    respawn in enemy land, or stay and build from the ground up again.<br>The season ended shortly
                    after.</p>

                <h3>Trivia</h3>
                <p>Here is one of the surviving video messages sent by AdaxJouse, around the time of Wars End <a

                <h3>Consistent Players</h3>
                <p>Only 3 players have been in every season; <a href="#adaxjosue">@AdaxJosue</a>, GameFlame380344 and <a
                        href="#bmbxbby">@Bmbxbby</a> with a total of all 5. The second place is <a

                        href="#treflecrystal">@TrefleCrystal</a> (Missed S1 and S2); fourth place is shared with too
                    many people to list.</p>

                <p><a href="#adaxjosue">@AdaxJosue</a> and GameFlame380344 were always at war with <a
                        href="#bmbxbby">@Bmbxbby</a> and <a href="#djzombiehunter">@DJzombiehunter</a>, usually under
                    the names "RWA" and "Vietnam" (S1 & S5:C) or "Snowdin Peoples Republic" (S4) (or something similar
                    to that) respectively.</p>
                <h3>Trivia</h3>
                <p>As of now, it seems only 1 work file has been saved as a backup on a device, the Season 5 world file.
                    All the others have been either lost or overwritten. If <a href="#adaxjosue">@AdaxJosue</a> could
                    hand over the world files, I'll update this and post a download link.</p>
