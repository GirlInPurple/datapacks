                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>With connections to The Borderlands from the road to the south and Middle Spawn and Spawn City [3] from the Jungle and Oak lines respectively, it could be considered one of the 3 suburbs of the main city; the other two being World Origin Road [2] and The Borderlands [1]. It contains a mountain with a glowing cube on top, a small plains village to the east, and a dual railway passing straight through the city; all with the theme of glowing purple crystals.
                FRTA Road 4 passes through the town, heading to Yuri's town.
                As of Late July 2023, construction of Cublak is paused.</p>

                <h2>Southcraft Season 1</h2>
                <h3>Members and Groups</h3>
                <p>The main members for this season are BmBxBBy, <a href="#djzombiehunter">@DJzombiehunter</a>, AdaxJouse, Gameflame, ToastistGraph23, and several others that have stayed unknown or neutral; with the main groups being the RWA and Vietnam</p>

                <h3>The Withering War</h3>
                <p>The Siege of Spike Hill<br>The first major battle between the two factions, the newly formed "Vietnam", and a faction soon to be called "The RWA" (stands for Realm Wide Assassins) was fought over 17 slimeballs.<br>Granted we were pretty easy targets hunkered down in a small shack in an icespikes biome, but we did not need to have our base irreparably griefed because we wanted payment. bmbxbby, who was the one who initially started the entire conflict between the two factions, just didnt want to pay and instead said "i pay with your blood on my blade" and it caused the entire faction to flee northward to find a jungle, our new home.<br>Shifted Blame:<br>bmbxbby killed Gameflame.<br>And then shifted the blame onto us saying i paid for the assassination.<br>Gameflame saw through this and promptly kicked him out of the newly formed RWA; he then took refuge in our jungle bunker. There were pros and cons to this.<br>Pros:<br>Maxed-out diamond gear<br>Cons:<br>The RWA knows our location and has dropped 3 wither nukes on us, confirmed by video on 17/06/2021.<br>That was the very tiny peak of Vietnam's reign over the jungle<br>Wars End:<br>Because the jungle was so far out from spawn, around 15km, once our beds were destroyed we were doomed to respawn far away from the ruins. Thankfully i survived the raid and was able to last until they left, but our base was a bomb crater at that point, so I had two options; kill myself and respawn in enemy land, or stay and build from the ground up again.<br>The season ended shortly after.</p>

There are too many people who have joined after and have been active since to list here, but most are fairly well known names here.</p>

                <h3>Trivia</h3>
                <p>The original spelling of the name is "finalrepublic" but spelling it "final republic" is perfectly fine as people will get what you're saying.<br>The game series Final Fantasy was made as Square Enix's final attempt at a popular game, and managed to make it work. Final Republic's name is for a similar reason, this was intended to be my last fully public server before closing it all down, and then the server exploded in popularity, casuing the whole of FR S2 to set into motion.<br>The following is the oldest surviving screenshot of this server's world: <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1061516148325220455/1133123214017564824/2023-01-14_14.png">Screenshot Link</a></p>

                <p>Names</p>
                <p>This town was known under 3 different names, here they are listed;</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ocean Plains:</strong> This was the name of the canceled FRTA Metro Station to go to this area; it has since become the common name for this region. It was supposed to be the second station on what was then the Mushroom Line but now would be on the Spruce Line.</li>
                    <li><strong>Golden Bay City:</strong> The original name of the city, the town being meant to be the richest and most prosperous town on the server.</li>
                    <li><strong>Golden Knights Castle:</strong> The name of the only remaining building residing in its borders, the ruins of the old castle of the Golden Knights.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>History</p>
                <p><strong>Construction:</strong> Sometime in Early May 2023, <a href="#djzombiehunter">@DJzombiehunter</a> and @RainForCraft started construction on the castle for a failed group called The Golden Knights.</p>
                <p><strong>Deconstruction:</strong> Due to @RainForCraft leaving the server, possibly permanently, me and...</p>
                <p><strong>Revival:</strong> @ToxicTrapper has expressed interest in gaining ownership of this base, and it will be granted whenever he is ready.</p>

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>@Bench created the town shortly after joining. They then left to join another server after around a week of playtime. They left behind their old gear in a chest labelled for new players only, then left the discord and minecraft servers, never to join again. The messages can be found here: ⁠genderal⁠</p>

                <h3>Trivia</h3>
                <p>The Chimken Cult was formed after @RainForCraft <a href="#djzombiehunter">@DJzombiehunter</a> and @Bench all wore chicken heads that were obtained from a chicken farm in the city. I recommend you dont question in, if only for your sanity.</p>
                <p>The cities only shop (and one of the very few builds at all) has an exact replica planned to be built in the shopping district.</p>
                <p>This city did not have a wiki page until after the new owner, @lionking234578 took over. The reason why is unknown.</p>

                <p><a href="#adaxjosue">@AdaxJosue</a> and GameFlame380344 were always at war with <a href="#bmbxbby">@Bmbxbby</a> and <a href="#djzombiehunter">@DJzombiehunter</a>, usually under the names "RWA" and "Vietnam" (S1 & S5:C) or "Snowdin Peoples Republic" (S4) (or something similar to that) respectively.</p>

                <p>As of now, it seems only 1 work file has been saved as a backup on a device, the Season 5 world file. All the others have been either lost or overwritten. If <a href="#adaxjosue">@AdaxJosue</a> could hand over the world files, I'll update this and post a download link.</p>

                <p>Originally created by @RainForCraft, <a href="#djzombiehunter">@DJzombiehunter</a>, and @Bench, the Chicken cult was formed out of a joke where a few of us got our hands on chicken heads and made a cult out of it. It was originally formed in the city of <a href="#below-the-bedrock">Below The Bedrock</a>, but has since expanded to Spawn City and Rain's Unnamed Town. Due to @Bench and @RainForCraft quitting the server, the cult has all but disbanded.</p>

                <p>With connections to The Borderlands from the road to the south and Middle Spawn and Spawn City [3] from the Jungle and Oak lines respectively, it could be considered one of the 3 suburbs of the main city; the other two being World Origin Road [2] and The Borderlands [1]. It contains a mountain with a glowing cube on top, a small plains village to the east, and a dual railway passing straight through the city; all with the theme of glowing purple crystals. FRTA Road 4 passes through the town, heading to Yuri's town. As of Late July 2023, construction of Cublak is paused.</p>

                <p>All but two players on the server lived in this town, the excluded are @tacco2009 and @squeezal. The total population peaked at 4, with <a href="#djzombiehunter">@DJzombiehunter</a>, @TipDuy3010, @TrefleCrystal, and @zacrny all living in the cave.</p>

                <p>CaveTown is, unironically, built almost entirely in a cave, with only a small map wall, a single house, and ~0.2km of paths outside of said cave. The cave is a lush cave, around 40 blocks deep near city center and 50 blocks deep at the lowest. [2]. The surrounding regions are a snowy, regular taiga, and massive iceberg biome just off the coast.</p>

                <h3>Trivia</h3>
                <p>The term "DevilTown is best" comes from a sign at the very front staircase in the center of the town. An entire platform was dedicated to farming of all kinds and a hotel for new players. A carbon copy of the town is planned to be built in Spawn City, and was around 10% finished. When Spawn City was blown up, a good majority of the entrance was blown up as well. Building has since then ceased and has become a district in Spawn City. [1]</p>
